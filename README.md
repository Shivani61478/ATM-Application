# ATM-Application
## My ATM Project (Java, Way Cooler Than It Sounds!)

This project isn't your average bank management system (boring, right?). It's actually a full-blown ATM built with Java! Think of it as a mini-bank in your computer. 

*What it can do:*

* *Check your balance:* See how much cash you have stashed away (virtually, of course).
* *Take out cash:* Need some quick money? The ATM will dispense it (as long as you have enough, don't be crazy!).
* *Deposit cash (depending on the model):* Some ATMs let you put money in too, and this one can simulate that if you want. 
* *Navigate like a pro:* The system is split into 10 connected interfaces, making it super easy to jump between all the ATM features.

*Bonus points:*

* *Database connection:* Keeps your info safe and lets you see past transactions, just like a real bank.
* *Room to grow:* This is a solid base, and we could even add more features later on, like fancy mini-statements.

Basically, this project lets you play around with how an ATM works, all from the comfort of your computer. Pretty cool, right?
